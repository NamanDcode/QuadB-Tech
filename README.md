This project is a basic blockchain simulation implemented in Python. It demonstrates the fundamental concepts of blockchain, including block structure, hashing, proof-of-work, and validation.
Features
 
   Blocks contain an index, timestamp, transactions, previous hash, current hash, and nonce.
   SHA-256 hashing algorithm is used for security.
   Proof-of-Work mechanism to mine blocks.
   Blockchain validation to detect tampering.
